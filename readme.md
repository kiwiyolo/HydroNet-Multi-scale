The model mainly uses the vision fusion transformer (ViFT) structure based on transformer to extract the spatial information of meteorological ground elements under different spatial resolutions, and adds text, mainly the longitude and latitude information of target sites or sections, as a cue word. Guide the model to learn the nonlinear relationship between the input hydrometeorological elements and the target points, and transform the regional hydrometeorological information into the features related to the target points. Finally, the bidirectional LSTM is used to encode and decode the extracted time series of section point features. Through many iterations, the model can successfully capture or learn the nonlinear relationship between input precipitation, temperature and other factors and section water level, thus completing the rapid and real-time section information prediction and prediction. It provides guidance for the assessment of flood, landslide and other natural disasters in the next step, and provides effective and reliable reference materials for water-wading activities in a timely and rapid manner.
